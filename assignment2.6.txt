1.Write a program to accepts two numbers from stdin and find all the odd as well as even
numbers present in between them.

class Acad
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
int i,j;
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
i=s.nextInt();
j=s.nextInt();
for(int a=i+1;a<j;a++)
{
System.out.println(a);
}
}
}

2.Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked the reason, Joe said she is unable to complete
the task given by her teacher. The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the number entered
from stdin.


class Acad
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
int i;
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
i=s.nextInt();
for(int i=1;i<11;i++)
{
System.out.println(i+"*"+a+"="+(i*a));
}
}
}

3.Write a program consisting method sum() and demonstrate the concept of method
overloading using this method.

class Acad
{
static void sum(int x,int y)
{
System.out.println("Sum is:"+(x+y));
}
static void sum(double x,double y)
{
System.out.println("Sum is:"+(x+y));
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
int i,j;
double k,l;
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("enter two integers:");
i=s.nextInt();
j=s.nextInt();
sum(i,j);
System.out.println("enter two float value:");
k=s.nextDouble();
l=s.nextDouble();
sum(k,l);
}
}
